### Licensor ("We")
Daniel Garcia (cr0hn) - The entity offering the Software under these licensing terms and conditions.

Website: https://cr0hn.com

### The Software
DockerScan - A comprehensive Docker security scanning tool for detecting vulnerabilities,
secrets, supply chain attacks, and compliance issues. Each version of the software is made
available under these terms, as indicated by inclusion of this license document with the
distribution.

### License Grant
Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, We grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly perform, publicly
display, and redistribute the Software for any Permitted Purpose.

### Permitted Purpose
**A "Permitted Purpose" means any purpose other than a Competing Use.**

A **"Competing Use"** means use of the Software in or for a commercial product or service that:

1. **Offers Docker security scanning as a service** (SaaS, hosted, managed, or cloud-based)
   that competes with DockerScan or any commercial service we may offer using DockerScan.

2. **Sells, licenses, or distributes DockerScan** (or substantial portions thereof) as a
   commercial product or service.

3. **Provides commercial managed services** where DockerScan is a primary or substantial
   component of the service offering.

**Permitted Purposes explicitly include:**

- ✅ **Internal use** within your organization for security scanning
- ✅ **Non-commercial use** for educational, research, or personal projects
- ✅ **Professional services** where DockerScan is used as a tool (e.g., security audits,
     penetration testing, consulting) but is not the product being sold
- ✅ **Integration** into other software products where DockerScan is an ancillary component,
     not the primary value proposition
- ✅ **Open source projects** and community contributions
- ✅ **Commercial use** within your organization's internal operations and CI/CD pipelines

**Examples of Competing Uses (NOT permitted without express written permission):**

- ❌ Offering "Docker Scanning as a Service" commercially
- ❌ Selling hosted DockerScan instances
- ❌ Building a commercial SaaS platform primarily based on DockerScan
- ❌ Redistributing DockerScan as part of a commercial security product where it's a
     primary feature
- ❌ Creating a commercial managed service where customers pay primarily for DockerScan
     functionality

### Change Date

OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### Trademarks
This license does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks,

## Grant of Future License
On the Change Date, or the fourth anniversary of the first publicly available distribution
of a specific version of the Software under this License, whichever comes first, We grant
you rights under the terms of the Change License, and the rights granted in the paragraph
above terminate.

If your use of the Software was previously a Permitted Purpose, this transition to the
Change License does not affect your right to continue to use the Software under the
Change License.

## Additional Terms
