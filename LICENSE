### Permitted Purpose
**A "Permitted Purpose" means any purpose other than a Competing Use.**

A **"Competing Use"** means use of the Software in or for a commercial product or service that:

   component of the service offering.

**Permitted Purposes explicitly include:**

- ✅ **Internal use** within your organization for security scanning
- ✅ **Non-commercial use** for educational, research, or personal projects
- ✅ **Professional services** where DockerScan is used as a tool (e.g., security audits,
     penetration testing, consulting) but is not the product being sold
- ✅ **Integration** into other software products where DockerScan is an ancillary component,
     not the primary value proposition
- ✅ **Open source projects** and community contributions
- ✅ **Commercial use** within your organization's internal operations and CI/CD pipelines
